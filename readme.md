# OfficeApplication

## Overview

**OfficeApplication** is an ASP.NET Core application designed to manage employee records, leveraging both SQL Server and MongoDB for data storage. This application provides a comprehensive set of features for handling employee data, including CRUD operations, data synchronization between SQL and MongoDB, and robust error handling. It utilizes best practices in software design, including dependency injection, error management, and unit testing with xUnit and Moq.

- **SQL Server:** Database for storing employee data.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for additional data storage.
- **HttpClient:** For making HTTP requests to external services if needed.
- **AutoMapper:** For mapping between SQL and MongoDB data models.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** For API documentation and testing.
- **xUnit:** Testing framework for unit tests.
- **Moq:** Mocking library for creating mock objects in tests.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **.NET SDK** (version 8.0 )
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code**
- **SQL Server** (Express or full version) or **LocalDB**
- **MongoDB** (for MongoDB operations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushchouhan/OfficeApplication.git
   cd OfficeApplication
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet Packages**

   Navigate to the project directory and restore the required packages:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Solution**

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Configure SQL Server ane MongoDB Connection String**

   Open `appsettings.json` and update the `ConnectionStrings` section with your SQL Server and MongoDB details:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true",
    "MongoDbConnection": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "MongoDbDatabase": "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"
     },
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*"
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Create Database Migrations**

   Generate migration scripts for SQL Server:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   ```

2. **Apply Database Migrations**

   Update the database schema:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The API will start, and Swagger UI will be available at `https://localhost:{PORT}/swagger` for exploration and testing.

### API Endpoints

#### Get Employees

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/employees`
- **Description:** Retrieves a collection of all employees.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` with employee data.
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected errors.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET https://localhost:5001/api/employees
```

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "employeeId": 1,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Hastings",
    "email": "David@pragimtech.com",
    "dateOfBirth": "1980-10-05T00:00:00Z",
    "gender": 0,
    "departmentId": 1,
    "photoPath": "images/john.png",
    "department": null
  }
]
```

#### Get Employee by ID

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/employees/{id}`
- **Description:** Retrieves an employee by their unique identifier.
- **Parameters:**
  - `id` (path) - Unique identifier of the employee.
- **Response:**
  - `200 OK` with employee data.
  - `404 Not Found` if the employee is not found.
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected errors.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET https://localhost:5001/api/employees/1
```

```json
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "firstName": "John",

}
```

## Database Migrations

The project uses Entity Framework Core for database operations. Follow these steps to manage migrations:

1. **Add a New Migration**

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName
   ```

2. **Update the Database**

   Apply the latest migrations to the database:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

3. **List Pending Migrations**

   To check for any pending migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations list
   ```

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for various components using xUnit and Moq. The tests ensure functionality and error handling are working correctly.

### Running Tests

1. **Navigate to the Test Project**

   ```bash
   cd OfficeApplication.Tests
   ```

2. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

### Test Coverage

- **Success Scenario:** Verifies that API endpoints return the correct status codes and data.
- **Error Handling:** Checks that the application handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.
